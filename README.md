# AOC 2022
Advent of Code

## Reflection
Day 1: 22 minutes
- Forgot how to read input stream from cin, but figured it out
- The first one keeps track of the maximum calories value carried by an elf
- The second part keeps track of the three top carlorie count carried by elves, and the solution maintains a fixed size (3) min PQ to keep track of top 3, and sums the top 3 at the end
